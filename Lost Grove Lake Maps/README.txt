README for Lost Grove Lake maps

NAD83 Layers folder - contains the layers clipped from county sized layers in their original NAD83 CRS (Coordinate Refereence System) from the Iowa Natural Resources Geographic Information Systems Library

WGS84 Layers folder - This contains the NAD83 layers 'warped' (re-projected) to WGS84 CRS.

Most GPSes use the WGS84 CRS and although many programs such as OziExplorer, and Fugawi can handle re-projection 'on the fly' Google Earth and maps Bing and other online maps are in WGS84 format and both of my depth mapping packages need WGS84 backround maps. I recommend the WGS84 layers be used for any editing or custom maps you may want to make

Finished Maps folder - All maps in this folder will be in WGS84 CRS format. This will hold a variety of finished background and and later depth maps in several formats

Finished Maps sub-folder - Orux Map Tiles -  contains tiled maps for OruxMaps (Android). To use just download the free OruxMaps app from the Google Play store and put the map folder(s) in the default directory. Usable as just a map with about any Android device and those with built-in GPS can make tracks and waypoints to mark and find fishing spots.
